# 🎬 Movie Success Prediction & Sentiment Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the key factors influencing **movie success** using structured (IMDB ratings, revenue, profit) and unstructured (audience sentiment) data.  
By applying **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and sentiment analysis**, the goal is to uncover trends that drive profitability and audience engagement.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Excel**: PivotTables, Charts for exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, filters, slicers  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Data querying and analysis  
- **NLTK (VADER)**: Sentiment analysis of reviews  

## 📊 Key Analysis  
- Designed and executed **SQL queries** on movie datasets (Netflix, IMDB).  
- Used **Excel PivotTables** to compare IMDB ratings, revenue, and profit against sentiment polarity (`TRUE = Positive`, `FALSE = Negative`).  
- Found that movies with **mixed/negative sentiment** surprisingly achieved **higher profit and revenue**, suggesting that polarizing films attract more attention.  
- Built **interactive Power BI dashboards** to explore metrics such as profit, revenue, and sentiment across genres.  

## 📈 Insights  
- **Sentiment does not always correlate with revenue**: Some blockbuster movies with mixed reviews generated higher revenue.  
- **Genre trends**: Action and Drama showed stronger variability in sentiment vs. performance.  
- **Visualization impact**: Dashboards enabled drill-down by genre, release year, and sentiment, simulating real-world decision-making.  

## ✅ Conclusion  
This project highlights the value of combining **data analytics and sentiment analysis** for predicting movie success.  
By blending statistical insights with visualization tools, stakeholders can better understand **content strategy, audience behavior, and profitability drivers**.
